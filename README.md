# Python_Project-
My first modula program 


This program should represent a working Rota to be used between staff and managers in a constantly changing working environment 

The program should take shift details and add them to a notice board that staff can view and query 

The manager will have a log in that gives them more access than staff 

This is my first attempt at program like this after starting my prgramming journey in March 2024
