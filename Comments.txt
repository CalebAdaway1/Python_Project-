
# This is my attempt at a modula design for my task manager 
# I haved decided to create a staff and manager rota 
# This will allow the manager to 
    # Add - View - Remove shifts 
    # Add - Remove staff members from the rota 
    # Review staff queries 

# This will allow the staff to 
    # View shifts 
    # Raise queries 

# Both staff and managers will have a staff id 
# The only thing i belive i need to create is the .txt file and directory 
# Looking for feedback on what I have created already 

# Corrections 
    # - added file_access.py, models.py - user.py 
    # generated requirments.txt while venv is active 
    # added JSON method to read user data from a file and convert into a list of 'user' objects
    # moved venv folder into gitignore 
    # updated Python to 3.12
